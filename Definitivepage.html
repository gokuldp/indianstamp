    A definitive stamp is a type of postage stamp that is issued for everyday use, as opposed to commemorative stamps, which are issued to mark a specific event or anniversary.

Definitive stamps typically feature a country's coat of arms, national symbols, or iconic landmarks. They are usually printed in large quantities and are available for purchase at post offices for an extended period.
